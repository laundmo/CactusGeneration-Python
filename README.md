Just import and use generate(seed), it's that simple!

https://github.com/KaptainWutax/CactusGeneration for the generation algorithm itself

I've done barely anything, just made it work in python, these guys deserve all the credit, especially kaptainWutax for his seedfinding (and similar) expertise!
